# The WITH_MENU option enables a dialog to choose some additional functions.
# Currently a frequency measurement at ATmega Pin PD4, a frequency generator at TP2 ,
# the external voltage measurement and C+ESR measurement can be selected. Of course you can also return to
# the normal transistor tester function and switch off the tester.

# With the menu item "Show data" the used icons and the font data are displayed for

# The menu function can be easier controlled with a incremental encoder (rotary switch).
# Both switches of the rotary switch can be connected with 1 kOhm resistors to PD1 and PD3.
# The common contact of the two switches must be connected to GND.
# You must also connect both switch contacts with two 10 kOhm resistors to VCC (pull up).
# The best choise is a incremental encoder with Push Button. The button can be connected
# parallel to the start key of the Transistor Tester.
# A define of the WITH_ROTARY_SWITCH enable the support for this extension.
# If your encoder has the same count of pulses at any switch as indexed positions (detent) for every turn,
# you should set the WITH_ROTARY_SWITCH to 2 or 3.
# If your encoder has twice the count of indexed positions, you should set the WITH_ROTARY_COUNT to 1.
# For rotary encoder without indexed position or with an indexed position at every change of
# the state of any switches (four times the count of pulses) you can set the
# WITH_ROTARY_COUNT to 5 for getting the best resolution.
# You can also use two separate push-buttons for Up and Down instead ot the rotary encoder.
# You must set the WITH_ROTARY_SWITCH to 4 for the UP/DOWN push-buttons.
