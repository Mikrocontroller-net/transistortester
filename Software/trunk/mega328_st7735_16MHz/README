This is 16 MHz version or tester with color LCD ST7735. I was bought in an Ukrainian shop. 


Thanks this guy https://github.com/robsoncouto/gm328a_rev_eng who traced the board find the PCB error because of that  the frequency measurement wasn't worked. The fix is easy enough but requires some skills. See photos.

Build
--------

1. If you're using custom toolchain the ./makew may help you to setup the build

2. make upload (or ./makew upload)

Note. Standard GNU build-tools likely never had -C  & --mcu options. So correct setup.mk in event avr-size will fail. Please advice me where to get patches to binutils for -C & -mcu options 

3. make fuses-crystal  (or ./makew fuses-crystal)

Note. if you're programming chip on the other place instead of the tester's board make sure you're added crystal and capacitors to be able reprogram chip
